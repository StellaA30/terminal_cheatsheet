# Terminal cheatsheet to use

* `mkdir` - create new folder
* `touch` - create new file and usually include file extension such as .md, .txt, .py. However, we can create files without any kind of extension
* `cd` - change directory
* `ls` - list folders and files  
* `ls -l`- returns a list of files and folders along with permissions, owner and date last modified
* `ls -a` - returns a list of files and folders including hidden files
* `pwd` - stands for print working directory and this allows you to check the folder we're currently in
* `open .` - use this to open all files in the current folder 
* `mv` - use this to either move a file to a different directory or rename
> Note: mv [file_name] .. using the .. shortcut allows you to move files in "the directory above this one"
* `cp` - used for copying a file
* `rm` - deletes a file

> Note: when using rm to delete a file, the deleted file does not go to the bin, so you cannot restore the deleted file after using rm
